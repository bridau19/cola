        <p id=intro>Throughout history, Coca Cola has relied on smart advertising to establish its brand as America's #1 refreshment, reflective of all the attributes of American idealism: hope, freedom, happiness, acceptance, and unity. It has been a huge part of global "Americanism," with its influence reaching into every country in the world (now with the exception of North Korea and Cuba, although this was not always the case). Here you will find an overview of Coca Cola's history and global dominance presented through a series of images that help communicate just how extensive and ubiquitous Coca Cola has become as a brand and symbol of American identity.</p>

      <p>The "A Coke is a Coke" 2019 Superbowl commercial featured the familiar tune from the 1971 "I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke," and featured similar themes of diversity and acceptance.</p>

The drink itself embodies many characteristics of American capitalism –– the company switched to high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar in 1984 to maximize profit margins, a change that has aided in the preservation of America's status as largest corn producer in the world, as well as it's obesity rate of over 40% as of 2020.</p><hr id=bottom>

      <p>Coca Cola may have done some good in spreading a few much-needed messages and using its influence to help others, but with that have come harmful consequences. Perhaps in the future, quality and health will become a top virtue in consumer products, but until then. . .</p>
